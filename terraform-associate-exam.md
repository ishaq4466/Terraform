### 1. Exam pattern(question type, duration, total question,online-offline, rescehduling, system requirement)

### 2. Experience

* **Exam level** - Will be easy for the one who used to touched TF cli in day-to-day life routine
* **Difficulty Level of questions** - some of the question can be answered within seconds, but some can be *Fuzzy* & tricky CLI command based. 
* **Preparation duration** - for experienced person can crack in atmost 2-3 weeks of preparations, for fresher which some prior knowlegde of init,plan,apply atleast 1month. `Just check the official study guide & evalute the experience level you have with terraform.`
> It depends on one's understanding capability & interest, the above are just estimates.
* **Tips** - try to review/write the tf code or the terraform registry module, as much as possible. Try to make changes as within those community modules as per your usecase.
